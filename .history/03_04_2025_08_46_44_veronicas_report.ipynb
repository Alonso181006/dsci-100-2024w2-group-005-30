    "K-NN classification will predict subscription status using played_hours and Age as numeric predictors and subscribe as the categorical response variable. This method is appropriate because K-NN works with numeric inputs while predicting categorical outputs. The first exploratory plot above suggests a non-linear relationship between the predictors, making K-NN a better choice than linear regression, which assumes linearity. Since the goal is to classify subscription status rather than predict a continuous value, K-NN classification is used instead of K-NN regression.\n",

Standardizing the data ensures both predictors contribute equally to distance calculations.\n",
