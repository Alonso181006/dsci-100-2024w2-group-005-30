    "In the gaming industry, understanding player behavior is crucial for designing engagement strategies and improving retention. One common strategy used by game developers is promoting in-game newsletters, which keep players informed about updates, events, and promotions. These newsletters are typically opt-in, meaning players choose whether or not to subscribe. Understanding what kinds of players are more likely to subscribe can help developers better target their communication efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to explore the question:\n",
    "**Can a player's playtime and age predict whether they subscribe to the game-related newsletter in <ins>players.csv</ins>?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By identifying potential patterns in subscription behavior based on quantitative characteristics, this analysis can offer insight into which types of players are more engaged or committed to the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this question, we used a dataset titled <ins>players.csv</ins>, which contains information on 196 individuals who play the game. This dataset includes 7 variables:\n",

This method is appropriate because K-NN is designed to handle numeric inputs while producing categorical outputs.\n",

This aligns with our context: players with similar playtime and age may exhibit similar engagement levels.

To mitigate this, we standardized the predictors so both contribute equally to distance calculations.\n",

    "The results of our analysis suggest that a player's playtime and age can predict newsletter subscription behaviour. Using a k-Nearest Neighbors model, the classification achieved an accuracy of 76.7%, a precision of 75.8% and a recall of 100%. All actual subscribers were correctly identified. However, 14 non-subscribers were misclassified, demonstrating that the model may sometimes tend to overpredict.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings are somewhat expected, as higher engagement often correlates with interest in in-game updates. This insight can help make marketing efforts more efficient by targeting regular gamers. Additionally, at a lower age, the importance surrounding what clutters your email inbox is less of a priority, and thus, students are more likely to provide their email for the newsletter that they might never read.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the model is imperfect, it offers information that can be used to explore other unknowns. Knowing that age and playtime contribute to whether a person subscribes to a game-related newsletter, researchers can investigate whether age is a stronger predictor than playtime. In addition, the specific age range that is most likely to subscribe can be investigated. Future work could explore other predictors, test other models, or analyze behavioural patterns over time to better understand subscription behaviour. In terms of applications for our model, it can improve efficiency on targetting users due to a recall of 100% mitigating any false negatives, which would help reduce resources towards acquiring users that are guaranteed to never subscribe.
