    "I propose using k-nearest neighbours regression to predict the number of hours played, as regression is utilized to predict strictly quantitative values. Linear regression was rejected due to outliers having too much influence on the line of best fit, and this small data set has numerous. A strength of K-NN regression is that it is a simple algorithm that requires few assumptions outside of scaling the data. However, a limitation of KNN is its poor performance when predicting values outside the training range, and with larger data sets, it becomes slow. In terms of assessing performance and finding a neighbour value, I’ll evaluate the metrics RMSE and RMSPE. Specifically, I’ll first start by splitting the dataset into 75% for training and 25% for testing, based on the played_hours. Then, I’ll use 5-set cross-validation and provide a range of k values from 1-10 to ensure the selected k performs consistently on the training data before implementing the model on the testing data."
