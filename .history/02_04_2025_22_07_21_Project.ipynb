    "In the context of online gaming platforms, identifying which players are most engaged can provide valuable insight for recruitment and retention strategies. Engagement is often measured by how much time players spend on the platform, and being able to predict this behavior based on other known characteristics could help platforms target specific player groups for marketing or community building.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explore the question:\n",
    "**Can we predict which players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data (i.e., total hours played) based on their experience level and whether they are subscribed to the game-related newsletter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a predictive modeling problem where the goal is to estimate a continuous numerical variable (hours played) using two categorical predictors (experience and subscription status). Since both predictors are non-numeric, we aim to apply a regression method that can handle categorical inputs effectively without requiring strong assumptions about the data.\n",
